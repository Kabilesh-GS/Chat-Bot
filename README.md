**Hey Everyone !**, Welcome to this repository. I made this application to mark my entry into AI. Comming from web-developer background, I wanted to explore the integration of AI in web-development. This project is more than sending and recieving message, it is my hands on attemt to knowing how conventional AI works and effective prompting.

**ChatftAI** is a sleek and interactive chatbot powered by Google's Gemini API. It features real-time user authentication, persistent chat storage using Firestore, and a smooth UI built with React. Axios handles the API requests while `ReactMarkdown` formats the chatbot responses beautifully.
